### Added

- NodeBalancers that are assigned to an individual Linode can be quickly viewed by accessing the Linode NodeBalanacers View ([GET /linode/instances/{linodeId}/nodebalancers](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-nodebalancers-view)) endpoint.

- Kubeconfig files for an LKE Cluster can be deleted and regenerated by accessing the Kubeconfig Delete ([DELETE /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/kubeconfig](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-kubernetes-engine-lke/#kubeconfig-delete)) endpoint.

- Specify a Payment Method when accessing the Payment Make ([POST /account/payments](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#payment-make)) endpoint by utilizing the new `payment_method_id` property.

### Changed

- Required properties stated by the specification have been fixed for the following endpoints:




### Fixed

- Previously, the specification erroneously stated that `google_pay` type Payment Methods could be added with the Payment Method Add ([POST /account/payment-methods](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/#payment-method-add)) endpoint. At this time, non-`credit_card` type Payment Methods can only be added using Linode Cloud Manager. The specification has been updated to remove the `google_pay` type from the endpoint's Request Body Schema accordingly.

- A bug was fixed that uploaded the SSH keys of deleted Users that were included in the `authorized_users` array when accessing the following endpoints:
  - Linode Create ([POST /linode/instances](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#linode-create))
  - Disk Create ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/disks](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#disk-create))
