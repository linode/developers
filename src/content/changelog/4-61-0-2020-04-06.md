changelog:
  - API

### Added

- You can now add tags when creating an LKE cluster ([POST /lke/clusters](/api/v4/lke-clusters/#post)). While the `tags` property existed before, the implementation logic has now been added to support adding tags to an LKE cluster.

- A `tags` property was added to the Update Kubernetes Cluster ([PUT /lke/clusters/{clusterId}](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id/#put)) endpoint. You can now update or remove existing tags on your LKE clusters. The `tags` property accepts an array of tags to be applied to your LKE cluster for organizational purposes.

- The [Images collection](/api/v4/images-image-id) now contains the `updated` property. This property returns the date that the current Image was last updated.

### Changed

- The [StackScript collection's](/api/v4/linode-stackscripts-stackscript-id) `deployments_total` property is now filterable. See [Filtering and Sorting](/api/v4/#filtering-and-sorting) to learn how to search API v4 collections.

### Fixed

- Validation has been included to prevent users from adding a credit card expiration year greater than 25 years from the current year. A user will now receive an `Expiry too far in the future` error message when this occurs. This bug fix affects the [POST /account/credit-card](/api/v4/account-credit-card/#post) `expiry_year` property.
