### Fixed

- Previously, when restoring from a backup ([POST
/linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-backups-backup-id-restore/#post)) to a Linode that was smaller than the Linode that the backup was created for, disk space could be overallocated. A 400 error message was added to inform the user if they are attempting to restore a backup to a Linode that does not have enough unallocated space available and overallocation caused by this bug is no longer possible.
