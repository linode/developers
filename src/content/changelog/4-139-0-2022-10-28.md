### Changed

* [Linode Compute Instances](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/) now include the read-only `host_uuid` property. This UUID identifies the compute instance's host machine, enabling potential failure point identification for applications running on multiple compute instances.

* **Managed Service Create** ([POST /managed/services](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/managed/#managed-service-create))
  * The `address` property for new Managed Services now has a limit of up to 100 characters.
