### Changed

- Updated the LKE Node Pool nodes array to return status information containing the node `id`, `instance_id` for the Linode if there is one, and node `status`. See the LKE Node Pool endpoints:

  - `List Node Pools` ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools))
  - `Create Node Pool` ([POST /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools/#post))
  - `View Node Pool` ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id))
  - `Update Node Pool` ([PUT /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id/#put))
  - `Delete Node Pool` ([DELETE /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id/#delete))

- Updated the Event (`List Events` ([GET /account/events](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-events)) and `View Event` ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-events-event-id))) action list to include the LKE node events:
  - `lke_node_create`
  - `lke_node_delete`
  - `lke_node_update` 

### Fixed

- Previously, `View Network Utilization` ([GET /account/transfer/](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-transfer)) did not include Object Storage outgoing network transfer in its network utilization for the current month. If you have the Linode Object Storage service enabled on your account, `View Network Utilization` will now include Object Storage's outgoing network transfer in its total returned amount.

- When a Linode, deployed from a ([StackScript](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-stackscripts)), is deleted, that StackScript's `deployments_active` value should decrease. This property's value was incorrectly reporting the number of active deployments for a StackScript. This has been corrected.

- Previously, after booting a Linode into rescue mode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/rescue](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-rescue/#post)), when attempting to reboot your Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/reboot](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-reboot/#post)), you would receive an error message, `No bootable config found`. This bug has been fixed and the Linode will reboot into the latest configuration profile that isn't a rescue mode configuration profile.

- Restoring a Linode ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-backups-backup-id-restore)) from a backup that was still in its postprocessing phase returned the error message "*backup is not valid*". The error message has been updated to be more descriptive. Now, when you attempt to restore a Linode from a backup that is still post processing, the returned error message is "*Backup is currently postprocessing*".

- Iterated on a bug fix with migrations, clones, and host information. If the migration is a disk **or** a clone, the `from_host` is the disk. Users can see migration job information in the event endpoints:
  - `List Events` ([GET /account/events](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-events))
  - `View Event` ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-events-event-id))

- Fixed the url in the `Close Support Ticket` ([POST /support/tickets/{ticketId}/close](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/support-tickets-ticket-id-close/#post)) endpoint's Request Sample shell curl example.
