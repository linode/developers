### Changed

* Removed `edit_mode` as an option for a Domain's `status` property.
  * Use the [/domains](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/domains) collection to review your account's domains.

### Fixed

* When a restricted user with the `add_longview` grant creates a Longview client, that user should have `read_write` permissions on the new client. 
  * The API correctly grants this permission, and so a user could make successful Update Longview Client ([PUT /longview/clients/{clientId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/longview-clients-client-id/#put)) endpoint requests for the new client.
  * However, the API would incorrectly report that the user had `read_only` permissions for that Longview client when viewed with the View User's Grants ([GET /account/users/{username}/grants](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-users-username-grants)) endpoint. 
  * This has been corrected, and this endpoint will now report `read_write` permissions for the new client.
* Fixed an issue where the `duration` of an Event with a `status` of `failed` would indefinitely increase. 
* Fixed an issue where entering Isle of Man's country code with the Update Account ([PUT /account](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account/#put)) endpoint. 
* Updates to Domains:
  * Resolved an issue when importing domains which caused server errors for the API.
  * Previously, the API would only check if a CNAME for a Domain was unique among all of that Domain's CNAME records. The API will now check to make sure that a CNAME has a name that is unique among all of a Domain's records.
  * Use the [/domains](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/domains) collection to review your account's domains. Use the Import Domain ([POST /domains/import](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/domains-import/#post)) endpoint to import domains with the API.
* Previously, the API documentation noted that the `last_successful` property of a Linode's `backups` property would return `None` if no backup had been completed for that Linode. The API actually returns `null` under this circumstance, and the documentation has been updated to reflect this.
  * Use the List Linodes ([GET /linode/instances](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances)) endpoint to list all of your Linodes, and use the View Linode ([GET /linode/instances/{instanceID}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id)) endpoint to view a single Linode.
* Updates to Invoices and InvoiceItems:
  * The API was inappropriately rounding the `unitprice` on InvoiceItems for certain Linode products. For example, the API would report .01 for the `unitprice` of an InvoiceItem for a Nanode, while the hourly cost of a Nanode is .0075. This issue did not affect the actual amount billed to a customer.
  * The `unitprice`, `amount`, `tax`, and `total` properties of an InvoiceItem and the `subtotal`, `tax`, and `total` properties of an Invoice were previously documented as having the type `integer`, but the API accepted and returned numbers with decimal points. The documentation for these types now list these properties as having the type `number`.
  * Removed `prepay` as an option for the `type` of an InvoiceItem in the API documentation. Prepaid billing reached end of life in March of 2019.
  * Use the List Invoices ([GET /account/invoices](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-invoices)), View Invoice ([GET /account/invoices/{invoiceId}](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-invoices-invoice-id)), and List Invoice Items ([GET](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-invoices-invoice-id-items)
    [/account/invoices/{invoiceId}/items](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-invoices-invoice-id-items)) endpoints to review your Invoices and InvoiceItems.
