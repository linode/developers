### Added

- The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the DNS resolvers for a region are now accessible at the View Region ([GET /regions/{regionId}](/api/v4/regions-region-id)) endpoint.

### Changed

- Changing your Longview subscription is no longer available at the Update Account Settings ([PUT /account/settings](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) endpoint. Accordingly, the `longview_subscription` property has been removed from the Update Account Settings request body. To update your Longview plan, please use the Update Longview Plan ([PUT /longview/plan](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) endpoint.

- Updated the description and response for the View Longview Plan ([GET /longview/plan](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) endpoint:
  - The previous description stated that this endpoint returns a `longview_subscription` ID. This has been corrected to state that the response consists of a LongviewSubscription object for your current Longview Pro plan, or an empty set `{}` if your current plan is Longview Free.
  - The response body and sample have been updated to include the details of the returned LongviewSubscription object for your current Longview plan.

- Accessing the View Longview Plan ([GET /longview/plan](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) endpoint now requires one of the following `global` [User Grants](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/):
  - `"account_access": read_write`
  - `"account_access": read_only`
  - `"longview_subscription": true`
  - `"add_longview": true`

- Updated the description, request, and response for the Update Longview Plan ([PUT /longview/plan](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) endpoint:
  - The previous description stated that this endpoint returns a `longview_subscription` ID. The description has been corrected to state that the response consists of a `LongviewSubscription` object for the updated Longview Pro plan, or an empty set `{}` if the updated plan is Longview Free.
  - Accessing this endpoint now requires `"longview_subscription": true` as a `global` [User Grant](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/).
  - The required OAuth scope has been changed from `account:read_write` to `longview:read_write`.
  - The request body schema has been updated to specify possible values for the `longview_subscription` field and to reflect that it is nullable, with a `null` value corresponding to Longview Free.
  - The response body and sample have been updated to include the details of the returned `LongviewSubscription` object.

- Updated the response for the List Longview Subscriptions ([GET /longview/subscription](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) and View Longview Subscription ([GET /longview/subscriptions/{subscriptionID}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) endpoint:
  - The response `id` property has been revised to specify possible values.

- Updated the Object Storage Bucket response schema to include the `size` property in the List Object Storage Buckets ([GET /object-storage/buckets](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/)), Create Object Storage Bucket ([POST /object-storage/buckets](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/)), View Object Storage Bucket ([GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}/{bucket}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/)), and List Object Storage Buckets in Cluster ([GET /object-storage/buckets/{clusterId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/object-storage/)) endpoints.

### Fixed

- A bug that prevented the Update Longview Plan ([PUT /longview/plan](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/longview/)) endpoint from functioning has been fixed. The endpoint will now update your account's Longview plan as expected.
