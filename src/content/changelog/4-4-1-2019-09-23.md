  - API

### Added
- Added the Enable Linode Managed ([POST /account/settings/managed-enable](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-settings-managed-enable/#post)) endpoint to Account.
  - This endpoint enables Linode Managed for the entire account and sends a welcome email to the account’s associated email address.
  - [Linode Managed](https://linode.com/docs/platform/linode-managed/) is an incident response service that can monitor any software stack or service reachable over TCP or HTTP.

### Changed

- The List Notifications endpoint ([GET /account/notifications](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-notifications)) now provides more detailed information when a pending host migration or DC migration ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/migrate](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-migrate/#post)) for a Linode is initiated. This information includes:

  - How many Linodes are in the queue ahead of your Linode. The Linode's position is dynamically generated, so if the notification is retrieved at an interval, it is always up-to-date.

### Fixed

- Previously, when restoring a Linode from a backup ([POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/backups/{backupId}/restore](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/linode-instances-linode-id-backups-backup-id-restore/#post)) with `overwrite:true`, some disks on the Linode were not properly deleted. This bug has been fixed. Additionally, the check to determine if the Linode has enough free disk space during a backup restore has been improved.

- The List Support Tickets endpoint ([GET /support/tickets](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/support-tickets)) will now properly honor the `order_by` and `x-filter` query parameters.
