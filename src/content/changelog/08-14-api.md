### Added

- Added the *active_promotions* property to Accounts, as returned by the View Account ([GET /account](https://developers.linode.com/api/docs/v4#operation/getAccount))) endpoint. This property lists all active promotions on your account.

    Promotions generally offer a set amount of credit that can be used toward your Linode services, and the promotion expires after a specified date. Simply put, a monthly cap on the promotional offer is set. In other words, a promotion offers a certain amount of credit every month, until either the expiration date is passed, or until the total promotional credit is used, whichever comes first.

- Added *promotion* to the types of Notifications that can be returned by the List Notifications ([GET /account/notifications](https://developers.linode.com/api/v4/account-notifications)) endpoint.
