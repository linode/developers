version: 4.63.0

  - API

### Changed
- The [Linode Kubernetes Engine](https://www.linode.com/products/kubernetes/) (LKE) is out of Beta. All [LKE endpoints](/api/v4/lke-clusters) now point to the `/v4` server instead of the `/v4beta` server.
  - **Note:** All `/v4` endpoints are available from the `/v4beta` server.

- The View Kubernetes API Endpoint  ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/api-endpoint](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-api-endpoint)) has been removed from the API in favor of the List Kubernetes API Endpoints ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/api-endpoints](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-api-endpoints)) endpoint.

### Fixed

- A bug was causing LKE nodes in the process of being deleted to still appear as part of an LKE node pool. This bug has been fixed.
	- You can view an LKE cluster’s node pools with the View Node Pool endpoint ([GET /lke/clusters/{clusterId}/pools/{poolId}](/api/v4/lke-clusters-cluster-id-pools-pool-id)).
