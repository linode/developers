### Added

- Linode's new Mumbai data center is now an available region ([GET /regions](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/regions/)).

- Added a new account cancellation endpoint: [POST /account/cancel](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/). This endpoint accepts an optional comments field and responds with a link to Linode's  exit survey.

- Added a new *profile\_update* event action to the List Events endpoint ([GET /account/events](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) and View Event endpoint ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

    This event will be issued when making requests to the [PUT /profile](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/profile/) and [PUT /profile/preferences](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/profile/) endpoints.

- Added User event actions to the List Events endpoint ([GET /account/events](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) and View Event endpoint ([GET /account/events/{eventId}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)).

    - *user\_create* - This event will be issued when making requests to the [POST /account/users](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/) endpoint.

    - *user\_update* - This event will be issued when making requests to the [PUT /account/users/{username}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/) and [PUT /account/users/{username}/grants](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/) endpoints.

    - *user\_delete* - This event will be issued when making requests to the [DELETE /account/users/{username}](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/) endpoint.

### Changed

- Changed behavior of the *configs* parameter for the [POST /linode/instances/{linodeId}/clone](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/) endpoint. When an empty array is passed to the *configs* parameter, no configuration profiles will be cloned from the source Linode.

    Previously, all configuration profiles would be cloned. All behaviors of the *disks* and *configs* parameters for this endpoint are now more extensively documented in the API reference.

### Fixed

- When updating the email of an account ([PUT /account](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/account/)) or of a user ([PUT /profile](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/profile/)), Linode will now send an email notification to the previous email address that describes this change.

- Fixed an issue where a user could not set permissions on a domain that contained errors.

- Fixed a malformed URL in the response for the Enable Managed Service endpoint ([POST /managed/services/{serviceId}/enable](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/managed/)).

- Fixed an issue in which SRV records could only be assigned a port number below 32767. Any port number is now accepted.

- Fixed a login error that could appear after a user's session had expired, if the user also had two-factor authentication enabled.

- Reduced response time for the [GET /support/tickets](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/support/) endpoint.
