We have listened to your feedback and are finally introducing a new compact theme so that you can see more of your resources on one screen. We know some of you use a vertical layout or have become accustomed to the condensed view of Classic Manager. Check it out by using the feature toggle at the bottom left of the Cloud Manager and selecting normal or compact view. 

Additionally, as a follow up to the refined search capabilities released in v0.49.0, we have added a tip on the Search bar. This will remind you of the fields and operators you can utilize to produce targeted search results.
